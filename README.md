The dealer is a devil in human disguise and he tryna trick player in to playing with him by disguise as a human play a calm music trick player to play with him by telling them to press enter to play, the bet is a you soul. If you win you get a revive, if you lost you soul is consume by the devil and die forever.
The voice line in a white text is when he speak in a polite maner, but he also imply in his voice line that he's a devil, a hint for a player.
The voice line in a red thes is when he speak with his devil voice.
And the reason why no one in this place is because no one dare to bet their soul. You can see in the devil voice line he's very surprise in your boldness.

- "Youâ€™ve come to gamble, havenâ€™t you? Be careful... the stakes are higher than you think."
- "The stakes are high, but whatâ€™s life without a little risk?"
- "Youâ€™ve got the courage to play, but will you have the courage to face the outcome?"
- "So, you're here to test your luck? Itâ€™s not often I get visitors with such... boldness."

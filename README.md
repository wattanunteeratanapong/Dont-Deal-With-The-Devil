# Don't Deal With The Devil
You‚Äôre dead now ‚Äî though you don‚Äôt remember it ‚Äî and somehow you‚Äôve ended up in this weird, empty casino. The only person here is the dealer‚Ä¶ or at least, that‚Äôs what you think. He‚Äôs actually the devil in disguise, trying to trick you into playing his game.

He plays calm music, acts friendly, and tells you to ‚ÄúPress Space to play.‚Äù The bet? Your soul. If you win, you get revived. If you lose, the devil takes your soul, and you‚Äôre gone forever.

White text in his dialogue means he‚Äôs speaking politely, though he‚Äôs dropping subtle hints that he‚Äôs actually the devil. Red text means he‚Äôs speaking in his true devil voice. The reason the casino is empty is simple ‚Äî nobody dares to bet their soul. That‚Äôs why, when you accept his challenge, you can hear in his devil voice that he‚Äôs genuinely surprised by your boldness. <br><br>

### Easter Egg
You close the game tab and leave the casino. Eventually, you just accept life in hell as it is ‚Äî after all, humans shouldn‚Äôt mess with the natural rule of death. The game‚Äôs name warned you already. XD<br><br>

- "You run out of the hell gate as fast as you can."
- "You breathe heavily, and your heart races."

- "Ha ha ha..."
- "Your soul will serve me for eternity."
- "The contract is complete. Your soul belongs to the house."
### Lose More than 1 times

Prompt &nbsp;:&nbsp; "A sleek, red-and-black themed casino stands boldly in the center of a bustling city. The city itself is eerily normal, with buildings and streets resembling any typical urban landscape. Above, the sky is painted an unsettling shade of orange, swirling with dark red clouds that give the entire scene a surreal, foreboding atmosphere. The contrast between the city’s everyday appearance and the unnatural, fiery sky creates a captivating yet ominous setting." <br><br>
